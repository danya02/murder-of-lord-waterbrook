`0.30` This is Lord Waterbrook. 

`0.33`  By the way, milord, why are you holding the fork in your right hand, and the knife in your left hand?

`0.38` It's more comfortable for me. 

`1.00` *The murder of Lord Waterbrook*

`1.07` *«Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson»* by Alexander Bubnov

`1.23` *Baker st. 221b*

`1.30` *Mrs. Hudson*

`1.34` *Dr. Watson*

`1.37` *Mr. Sherlock Holmes*

`2.02` It's a bullet. 

`2.05` My god, Holmes! It's an attempted murder!

`2.11` No, Watson, it's a murder. 

`2.16` So, Watson, here is our house's window. There is a bullet hole in it. 

`2.20` Now look at this tree.  

`2.25` See the broken branch? We connect those two points with a dashed line and we continue it. 

`2.30` We get the third point - the opposing house's window. 

`2.36` That's where the bullet came from, and that's where the murder occurred. 

`2.40` Elementary, Watson!

`2.47` I understood that that's the house before you finished explaining. 

`2.55` Really? I seem to have underestimated you. How?

`3.00` There's a policeman in front of the house. The police must've been notified. 

`3.07` Excuse me, sir…  sorry… sorry…

`3.13` Good morning, constable. Is Inspector Lestrade already here?

`3.17` And who are you supposed to be?

`3.26` This is the greatest detective of all times Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 

`3.33` I'm his friend and assistant Dr. Watson. 

`3.36` You do read books, don't you?

`3.40` Why, I do. For example… *"The Charter of Guard Duty"*… what else…

`3.45` Did you happen to read Conan Doyle, sir?

`3.48` Er…

`3.50` Shame on you, dear. But, all right. Here's a copy with an autograph and pictures.

`3.57` Let's go, Holmes.

`4.03` Settle down, please. They're allowed to come, they're from Conan Doyle. 

`4.12` Here, Watson, let's continue our dashed line…

`4.20` Right here is the first corpse. 

`4.25` There are several? 

`4.27` At least two. I could see it after studying the bullet. 

`4.32` Your business card, please, Sir… How do you want to be announced?

`4.40` You won't ever be able to announce anybody, my poor friend -  you were murdered.

`4.44` Sorry, sir - I'm not yet used to it.

`4.50` And here is the bullet hole; the bullet flew right through the door and the head of this poor fellow, who was standing here so unfortunately.

`5.05` Look here, Watson!

`5.10` See? 

`5.14` Holmes! *(This is Inspector Lestrade.)*

`5.19` Unbelievable! But how? How did you know?

`5.27` You don't want to shake the hand of a Scotland-Yard inspector?

`5.35` Watson, help me out!

`5.44` Of course not, inspector! Here's my hand!

`5.47` By the way, what kind of bumpkin did you put on the doorstep?

`5.50` Exactly, he didn't want to let us in.

`5.55` Ah, Watson, you're here too? But where would you go one without another…

`5.59` Here, gentlemen…

`6.19` Smith, you're free to go.  

`6.21` As you wish, sir!

`6.26` And call Sergeant Baskerville with the hound. 

`6.32` Your opinion, Mr. Holmes?

`6.48` The gun is from there? 

`6.51` Yes. All of them are loaded. 

`6.55` Yorkshire weapon factory. I see…

`7.00` Stamp removed. 1712-th year.

`7.04` 1713-th, rather. 

`7.07` Fingerprints?

`7.10` None, but it doesn't matter.  Everyone in this house, including the lord's wife, wears white gloves. 

`7.16` He was a bit paranoid about universal cleanliness.

`7.20` I have no doubt, inspector, that you have an opinion on the events.

`7.24` Of course!

`7.25` Why don't you tell us about is?

`7.30` Let's see, well… It's rather obvious to me – it's a suicide, gentlemen, a common suicide.

`7.44` A suicide? During breakfast?

`7.47` The late lamented was an eccentric, unbalanced person. Confirmed by all the ménage. Anything could deeply upset him.

`7.56` For example, some failed roast.

`8.12` But it's excellent – try it, Watson!

`8.25` It really is very good!

`8.30` Let me, gentlemen!

`8.34` Inspector, don't forget, you're not alone here!

`8.44` Gentlemen, you ate three pieces each, and I got only two!

`8.50` You're counting pieces? Shame on you, inspector!

`9.00` Yep… Do you have your own version?

`9.04` I'd like to talk to the ménage.

`9.12` *This is the lord's ménage, all four of them. The lord's wife, Lady Waterbrook, his personal driver…*

`9.17` *...a young maid with a giant breast and a Chinese cook.*

`9.25` Apologies for bothering you again, milady, but Mr. Holmes would like to ask you several questions. 

`9.30` Milady, please accept my condolences.

`10.14` That's what I thought. 

`10.15` Mary!

`10.16` Now I got it.  The lord seduced the maid…

`10.22` What?!  

`10.23` Silent, you're dead. 

`10.27` …promising riches, possibly, even a divorce with milady and a marriage with her.

`10.35` And denied his promises when she got pregnant.  The victim then decided to take revenge. 

`10.40` Today, you entered his study.  

`11.21` Elementary, Watson! That's what happened, Mary?

`11.31` Watson, help!

`11.44` Hot water and clean blankets, fast!

`12.02` It's a boy!

`12.12` But… he's Chinese!?

`12.23` Fun Lin, I'm ashamed of you!

`12.36` Yeah… what a great version that was… something's not right here.

`12.45` However… the lord seduced the maid, desperately she entered a relationship with the Chinese, planning to marry him,

`13.00` but when the Chinese knew that  his bride has been dishonored, he has decided to take revenge.

`13.19` …unusual… unusual for cooks.

`13.25` The cook first wants to poison.

`13.30` I did so… I poisoned da lord. I made a poisoned roast.

`13.44` What poison was it? How much time do we have?

`13.57` What poison was it? How much time do we have?

`14.13` I put da poison in da sauce.

`14.17` The sauce we didn't eat.

`14.25` Fun Lin, what kind of bastard are you?

`14.28` Silent, murdered!  

`14.30` If the Chinese used poison, he didn't shoot. Who did?

`14.40` Holmes, don't you think that the porter might be the murderer?

`14.45` the porter? - Yes, the one behind the door. 

`14.50` You're forgetting that he was, somehow, murdered!

`14.53` He could've shot the lord, run forward and stood in the way of the bullet.

`15.00` Why? – To get himself an alibi.

`15.08` Hold that thought, Watson. There's something I'm missing. What?

`15.15` Watson, we're going home.

`15.18` Good luck, inspector… milady… 

`15.21` That's it! The missing link! 

`15.29` Milady, I dare assume that you're in a close relationship with the lord's driver.

`15.35` What!?

`15.36` How dare you! 

`15.38` The smell of motor oil from your skin.

`15.57` Furthermore, I dare assume that this gentleman is the lord's unlawfully born brother, wishing to claim inheritance. 

`16.08` Let's mentally remove his mustache, glasses and hat.

`16.18` Henry, and I thought of why you smell gasoline when you come to the bedroom!

`16.25` That's it! I've heard enough! 

`16.30` After all I've learned, I have a full right to shoot myself again.

`16.35` So it was, after all, a suicide?

`16.40` Exactly! And exactly because of the awful roast. 

`16.45` But I have now a good reason to do it. Farewell, Emma!

`16.55` Sergeant Baskerville with the service hound, sir!

`17.06` *The murder of Lord Waterbrook*

`17.08` *The suicide of Lord Waterbrook* 

`17.28` I knew it was a suicide all along.

`17.35` And all my versions were designed to force him to admit it.

`17.43` Yes, the late lamented are the most stubborn.
